The following error was detected in a GitHub Actions run:

Repository: {{ repository }}
Branch: {{ branch }}
Commit: {{ commit_sha }}

Analyzer output:
{{ analysis_result }}

Raw logs:
{{ raw_logs }}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON matching this schema:
{
  "proposed_diff": "string (unified diff)",
  "files_to_change": ["string", "..."],
  "rationale": "string"
}

Example:
{
  "proposed_diff": "--- /dev/null\\n+++ b/package.json\\n@@ ... (diff content here)",
  "files_to_change": ["package.json"],
  "rationale": "The error indicates that package.json is missing. Adding this file resolves the npm error."
}

Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "proposed_diff": "unified_example",
  "files_to_change": ["files_to_change_item1", "files_to_change_item2"],
